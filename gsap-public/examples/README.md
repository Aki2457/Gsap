# GSAP Examples

This folder contains small, self-contained demos that showcase common GSAP patterns and load the GSAP core plus plugins straight from the CDN, so there is nothing to install. Open any of the HTML files directly in a browser (double-click or use a static file server) to see the animation.

## Included demos

1. **basic-timeline.html** – A hero header animation that chains together multiple tweens inside a master timeline.
2. **scrolltrigger-gallery.html** – A vertically scrolling gallery that uses ScrollTrigger to pin panels and scrub through staggered transitions.
3. **draggable-carousel.html** – An interactive card carousel powered by the Draggable utility, complete with snapping and momentum.

Each demo imports scripts from the official GSAP CDN to stay in sync with the latest public build. Feel free to duplicate one of the templates to kick-start a new experiment.
